# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Unordered means that the items in a set do not have a defined order.
# Set items are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change the items after the set has been created.
# Sets cannot have two items with the same value.
myset = {"Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"}
print (myset)


# Duplicates Not Allowed
thisset = {"Mercedes", "Honda", "BMW", "Honda"}
print (thisset)


# The set() Constructor
aset = set(("Arsenal", "Real Madrid", "Liverpool"))
