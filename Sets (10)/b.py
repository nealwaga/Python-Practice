# Access Items.
# You cannot access items in a set by referring to an index or a key, but you can loop through. Example:
thisset = {"Lemon", "Citrus", "Guava"}
for x in thisset:
    print (x)
# or
print ("Citrus" in thisset)    


# Add Items
aset = {"Blue", "Red", "Green", "Yellow"}
aset.add("Purple")
print (aset)
