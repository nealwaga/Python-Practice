# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
# Tuples are written with round brackets. Example:
thistuple = ("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry")
print (thistuple)


# Tuple Length
atuple = ("Maryann", "Sharon", "Veronica", "Sophie")
print (len(atuple))


# The tuple() Constructor
thetuple = tuple(("Mercedes", "BMW", "Audi", "Range Rover"))
print (thetuple)
